# Visual Relationship Data Exploration [Link to Project Repository](https://github.com/KaanEnt/Visual-Relationship-Data-Exploration)

* Learned to use more detailed Data
* Learned to effectively Train and Test Datasets
* Further extended my knowledge on Data Exploration

In this Project, I have done the Data Exploration for a Dataset of 10GB worth of random images and created Training and Testing Datasets from that one big Dataset.
Here, I experienced how to work with a big enough Dataset and how much time it can take and through that learned about how I can optimize my time while working with such a set.


# TensorFlow Image Recognition [Link to Project Repository](https://github.com/KaanEnt/TensorFlow-Image-Recognition).

* Image Classification Prediction Program
* Learned to run more optimized Regression Models
* Learned to use Machine Learning to a larger extent

In this Project, I have created a Machine Learning Algorithm through usage of the TensorFlow package. This also is a Project that uses image Data but on a much smaller scale.
It is a Image Classification Prediction Algorithm that tells what is in the given image. I have managed to make the Algorithm more than 90% efficient on predicting the contents of the presented image.
Working with TensorFlow made me more familiar with Regression Models.


# AirBNB Customer Prediction [Link to Project Repository](https://github.com/KaanEnt/AirBNB-Prediction-Data-Exploration).

* Learned to do Data Cleaning and Data Exploration
* Learned to better document Data Science Projects with Notebooks
* Learned to Manipulate Graphs and DataFrames to a higher extent

In this Projects, I have gone through the Data Exploration Process of a Dataset containing the Dataset of AirBNB Customers.
My first experience with Data Cleaning and the concept of Data Exploration as a whole. Really further expanded my horizons on how different types of Data interacts with each other in different DataFrames.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
