# [Visual Relationship Data Exploration](https://github.com/KaanEnt/Visual-Relationship-Data-Exploration)

* Learned to use more detailed Data
* Learned to effectively Train and Test Datasets
* Further extended my knowledge on Data Exploration

In this Project, I have done the Data Exploration for a Dataset of 10GB worth of random images and created Training and Testing Datasets from that one big Dataset.
Here, I experienced how to work with a big enough Dataset and how much time it can take and through that learned about how I can optimize my time while working with such a set.


# [TensorFlow Image Recognition](https://github.com/KaanEnt/TensorFlow-Image-Recognition)

* Image Classification Prediction Program
* Learned to run more optimized Regression Models
* Learned to use Machine Learning to a larger extent

In this Project, I have created a Machine Learning Algorithm through usage of the TensorFlow package. This also is a Project that uses image Data but on a much smaller scale.
It is a Image Classification Prediction Algorithm that tells what is in the given image. I have managed to make the Algorithm more than 90% efficient on predicting the contents of the presented image.
Working with TensorFlow made me more familiar with Regression Models.


# [AirBNB Customer Prediction](https://github.com/KaanEnt/AirBNB-Prediction-Data-Exploration)

* Learned to do Data Cleaning and Data Exploration
* Learned to better document Data Science Projects with Notebooks
* Learned to Manipulate Graphs and DataFrames to a higher extent

In this Projects, I have gone through the Data Exploration Process of a Dataset containing the Dataset of AirBNB Customers.
My first experience with Data Cleaning and the concept of Data Exploration as a whole. Really further expanded my horizons on how different types of Data interacts with each other in different DataFrames.
